### Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of common-collector and common-emitter transistor configurations when used as microphone amplifiers. The study examines gain characteristics, input/output impedance matching, frequency response, and noise performance of both configurations to determine optimal design choices for audio applications.

### Introduction
Microphone amplifiers are critical components in audio systems, requiring careful consideration of gain, impedance matching, and noise characteristics. This analysis compares two fundamental transistor amplifier configurations to identify their suitability for microphone applications.

### Circuit Analysis
- **Common-Emitter Configuration**: Voltage amplifier with high gain and phase inversion
- **Common-Collector Configuration**: Voltage follower with unity gain and impedance transformation
- **Biasing Considerations**: Proper DC biasing for optimal AC performance
- **Small-Signal Analysis**: AC equivalent circuit analysis for gain calculations

### Performance Characteristics
- **Voltage Gain**: Common-emitter provides higher voltage gain
- **Input Impedance**: Common-collector offers higher input impedance
- **Output Impedance**: Common-collector provides lower output impedance
- **Frequency Response**: Analysis of bandwidth limitations and roll-off characteristics
- **Noise Performance**: Signal-to-noise ratio considerations for low-level audio signals

### Design Considerations
- **Impedance Matching**: Optimizing input/output impedance for microphone characteristics
- **Power Supply Requirements**: Voltage and current requirements for proper operation
- **Component Selection**: Resistor and capacitor values for desired performance
- **Layout Considerations**: PCB design for minimizing noise and interference

### Experimental Results
- **Gain Measurements**: Practical gain measurements vs. theoretical calculations
- **Frequency Response**: Measured bandwidth and roll-off characteristics
- **Noise Analysis**: Measured noise floor and signal-to-noise ratios
- **Distortion Analysis**: Harmonic distortion measurements at various signal levels

### Conclusions
The analysis reveals that common-emitter configuration provides superior gain characteristics for microphone applications, while common-collector offers better impedance matching properties. Optimal design requires careful consideration of application-specific requirements and trade-offs between gain and impedance characteristics.
