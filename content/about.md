I'm **Charles Marsh**, a passionate Computer Engineering student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I'm deeply interested in embedded systems, software development, and music technology.

Currently I am teaching Computer Science fundamentals, video game design, and other various computer literacy skills to kids aged 7-15 at Youth Tech Inc.

I will be graduating June 2026, where I will then be looking for a job in embedded systems or software engineering.
