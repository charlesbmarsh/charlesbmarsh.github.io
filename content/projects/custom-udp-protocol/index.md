**Networks Class Final Project** | Cal Poly



## Project Overview
Designed and implemented a custom reliable data transfer protocol that operates over UDP, incorporating TCP-like reliability features while maintaining UDP's lightweight nature. This project demonstrated deep understanding of network protocols and the challenges of building reliable communication over unreliable transport layers.

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened C programming skills and enhanced proficiency with command-line development tools (Vim, terminal, WSL).
- Developed a practical understanding of network transport protocols, including TCP and UDP.
- Successfully implemented key reliability and flow control mechanisms like acknowledgments, timeouts, and sliding windows.
