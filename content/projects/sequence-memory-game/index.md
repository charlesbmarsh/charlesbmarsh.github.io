## Project Overview
Implemented a Simon Says memory game inspired by humanbenchmark.com, featuring a 3x4 LED matrix that displays increasing sequence patterns for players to replicate using a keypad. The game progressively increases difficulty with longer sequences and faster timing, testing memory skills while demonstrating embedded systems knowledge.

## Technologies Used
- **C** Programming with STM32 microcontroller
- **I2C & SPI** communication protocols
- **STM32CubeIDE** development environment
