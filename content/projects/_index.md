# My Projects

Here's a collection of my academic and personal projects showcasing various skills in embedded systems, networking, computer architecture, and software development.

## Embedded Systems & Hardware

### [STM32 LED Sequence Memory Game](/projects/sequence-memory-game/)
**Embedded Systems Final Project** | Cal Poly SLO  
A Simon Says memory game implemented on STM32 microcontroller with 12-LED matrix, keypad input, and LCD display. Features progressive difficulty, high score tracking, and comprehensive embedded systems implementation.

### [Home Energy Management System](/projects/cal-poly-capstone/)
**Cal Poly Capstone Project** | Team Lead & Hardware Engineer  
Comprehensive home energy monitoring system with intelligent EV charging control to prevent electrical panel overloads. Combines IoT sensors, embedded systems, and adaptive control algorithms.

## Computer Architecture & Design

### [RISC-V OTTER Processor Implementation](/projects/risc-v-otter/)
**CPE 233/333 Computer Design & Architecture** | Cal Poly SLO  
Complete RISC-V processor architecture with 5-stage pipeline and branch prediction. Implemented in VHDL/Verilog with comprehensive testing and performance optimization.

## Networking & Distributed Systems

### [Reliable Data Transfer Protocol over UDP](/projects/custom-udp-protocol/)
**Networks Class Final Project** | Cal Poly SLO  
Built a reliable data transfer protocol over UDP with TCP-like flow control, reliability mechanisms, and packet recovery. Demonstrates advanced networking concepts and protocol design.

## Software Development & Web Applications

### [Web App - Server Management System](/projects/northrop-grumman-server/)
**Cal Poly Project** | Sponsored by Northrop Grumman  
Flask-based web application for streamlining internal processes and ticketing management on Cal Poly's graduate student server. Features modern web technologies and database integration.
